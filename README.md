This repo holds the R scripts for all the analysis of Caitlin Clark's 2024 WNBA season that I wrote about on my blog [here](https://aaroneolson.com/2024/09/29/caitlin-clark-s-historic-rookie-year/).

I calculated two metrics 'point shares' (the percentage of a team’s total points that a player accounts for) and 'assist shares' (the percentage of a team’s total assists that a player accounts for) to compare Clark to the last five seasons of both WNBA and NBA data.

This script utilizes the [wehoop](https://wehoop.sportsdataverse.org/) package to get WNBA data and the [hoopR](https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org/) package for NBA data.
